# linear_regression

Linear Regression allows you to predict a dependent variable with one or multiple independent variables. In other words, this tool will enable us to predict values. We can predict the height based on the weight or profit of companies based on what they spend on marketing, administration, and R&D. After fitting your model to the data (we also need to avoid overfitting it), we can predict values with relatively high accuracy.
In my following projects, I have performed two linear regression models:

- Predicting the height by using weight (simple linear regression)
- Predicting the profit of a start-up by using how much these start-ups spent on marketing, administration, and R&D

I have used Pythonâ€™s statsmodels library to set up the regression models.
